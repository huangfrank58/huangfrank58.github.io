		<p>COVID-19 is the disease that is caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, meaning Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus 2, and was 
		first discovered in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. SARS-CoV2 is a member of the coronavirus virus family, members of which affect 
		the upper respiratory tract, and include viruses such as the common cold, MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome), and SARS, to which 
		SARS-CoV2 is closely related to. Coronaviruses are a large family, and there are hundreds of coronaviruses, most of which affect animals 
		such as pigs, bats, and cats. In rare cases, these viruses can be transmitted from animals to humans in what is called a &ldquo;spillover event&rdquo;, 
		and the transmission of these viruses can cause diseases. Of the hundreds of viruses in this group, only 7 can affect humans. 4 of these 
		viruses cause only mild or moderate symptoms, but the remaining 3 can have more severe, and sometimes fatal, symptoms. SARS-CoV2 is one of 
		the 3 coronaviruses that can affect humans more seriously. COVID-19 is an enveloped virus, meaning that its genetic material is contained in
		an outer layer of proteins and lipids called the &ldquo;envelope&rdquo;. This envelope contains the spike proteins that are used by the virus to attach 
		to human cells during infection. The disease caused by SARS-CoV2 was highly contagious, and it spread through many regions of China and was 
		brought to countries around the world by travelers from impacted regions. By March 2020, the virus had been deemed a pandemic by the World 
		Health Organization (<a href = "https://www.who.int/">WHO</a>), indicating that it was &ldquo;...occurring worldwide, or over a very wide area, crossing international boundaries and 
		usually affecting a large number of people&rdquo;(<a href = "https://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/89/7/11-086173.pdf">Kelly 540</a>). In many countries, travel to and from other countries was restricted, and many 
		institutions, businesses, and amenities were closed in many regions to limit the spread of the virus. Preventative measures such as masking, 
		and the development and distribution of vaccines allowed these things to reopen, but they still close during spikes in infections to limit 
		the spread of the virus.
		</p>
		<h3 id = "COVID-19_spread">How Does COVID-19 Spread?</h3>
		<p>So how does COVID-19 spread, and why is it so infectious? COVID-19 is primarily transmitted through the respiratory droplets of an infected person, 
		especially when the person coughs or sneezes, and the disease is transmitted when another person inhales or is exposed to these droplets. Transmission
		can also occur if a person touches a surface contaminated by these droplets and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth, but the risk of transmission 
		through surfaces compared to airborne transmission, direct contact, and transmission by droplets. It is also possible for COVID-19 to spread from 
		humans to other animals through close contact, and examples have included companion animals and pets such as cats and dogs, minks on mink farms, animals
		at zoos, and wild white-tailed deer in many US states.

		<h3 id = "Common_Symptoms">Common Symptoms</h3>
		<p>COVID-19 has a wide range of symptoms depending on the severity of the illness, and symptoms tend to emerge 2-14 days after the infection. 
		Symptoms can include but are not limited to…
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Fevers</li>
			<li>Chills</li>
			<li>Coughing</li>
			<li>Shortness of breath and/or difficulty breathing</li>
			<li>Muscle aches, body aches, or headaches</li>
			<li>Loss of the sense of taste or smell</li>
			<li>Sore throat</li>
			<li>Congested or runny nose</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If you or someone else shows these signs, seek medical care…</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Trouble breathing</li>
			<li>Chest pain</li>
			<li>Confusion</li>
			<li>Discolored skin, lips, or nails</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 id = "High_Risk_Groups">Groups at a Higher Risk</h3>
		<p>Factors such as age and underlying health conditions such as &ldquo;...diabetes, hypertension, asthma, chronic lung disease, severe heart conditions, 
		chronic kidney disease, obesity or a weakened immune system&rdquo;(<a href = "https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/guidance-documents/people-with-disabilities.html">
		Public Health Agency of Canada</a>) can put people at a greater risk of suffering more serious consequences from COVID-19. However, this does not 
		mean that young and healthy people cannot suffer serious symptoms as well.
		</p>
		<h3 id = "Long_COVID">Long COVID</h3>
		<p>Most people affected by COVID-19 completely recover within a few weeks, but some people suffer lingering effects long after they have 
		recovered. These effects are often called &ldquo;long COVID&rdquo;, and while older people and people with underlying health conditions are the most 
		likely to experience long COVID, young and otherwise healthy people can be affected as well.</p>
		<p>Symptoms that linger over time include…</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Fatigue</li>
			<li>Shortness of breath and heavy breathing</li>
			<li>Coughing</li>
			<li>Faster heartbeat</li>
			<li>Fever</li>
			<li>Joint or chest pain</li>
			<li>Loss of smell or taste</li>
			<li>Depression or anxiety</li>
			<li>Dizziness</li>
		</ul>
